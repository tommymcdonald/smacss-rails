### SMACSS template for Rails applications
#### Based off of Jonathan Snook's book 'SMACSS'
https://smacss.com

Usage: Replace your stylesheets folder in your rails application with this folder.
I've also included an import statement for boottrap to be used with the bootstrap-sass gem.
<code>gem 'bootstrap-sass'</code>

It's truly that simple.
